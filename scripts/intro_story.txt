The rain hits your trench coat like a thousand whispered secrets, each droplet a phantom of Greywater City's sins. You stand over the body of Iris Bell, her once silken voice silenced forever, sprawled amidst the tattered feathers and broken dreams of The Silver Gull's backstage dressing room. The flickering bulb casts long shadows, dancing like specters on the damp, peeling wallpaper. Smoke curls from the forgotten cigarette in the ashtray, a lazy wisp that mingles with the scent of cheap perfume and tragedy. Outside, the neon glow of Dockside District flickers like a heartbeat, a city alive but rotting from within. Somewhere in this rain-soaked labyrinth lies the truth. Your job? Unearth it before it slips away into the shadows.
